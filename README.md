# Comprehensive Study of IoT Malware Classification Models: Insights into Temporal, Architectural, and Spatial Inconsistency Challenges

The repository is for the paper **Comprehensive Study of IoT Malware Classification Models: Insights into Temporal, Architectural, and Spatial Inconsistency Challenges**. It includes the source code for evaluation on IoT malware classification models under the challenge of temporal, architectural, and spatial inconsistency.

The experiment is performed using the [IoTPot](https://sec.ynu.codes/iot/) Dataset. Due to the confidentiality agreements that we have with these providers, we will not be able to redistribute the data to other interested parties. Despite that, the data is available for research purposes upon request from the source. We encourage interested researchers to contact the dataset providers directly to request access to the datasets, respectively.

The folder and file descriptions of the repository are as follows:

- **ELF-OT/**
